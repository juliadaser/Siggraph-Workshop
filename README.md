## About 
Welcome to your hands-on workshop at Siggraph 2024! Today, you would be making your very own pair of DIY Love Messengers! 
<br>
<br>
Our DIY Love Messengers are the perfect gift for your friends/ partners, especially long-distance ones! When the button of one love messenger is pressed, both of them will light up - no matter HOW FAR AWAY the two messengers are! We will be using all the files, code and 3D models from this repository in the SIGGRAPH workshop.

## Try it out yourself at home!
We also made a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot5ihNqtx74&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=WormiCollective) so that you can make these Love Messengers again at home. 
<br><br> Do note that the materials used for this tutorial is very slightly different from the one we used in the workshop (ie. we randomized the LED colors in the tutorial, but stuck to only one LED color in the SIGGRAPH workshop). You can choose to modify the materials used in the tutorial with the materials outlined in this github repository.
